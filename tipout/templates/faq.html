        <p>
          Your daily budget is calculated by finding your average daily income (based on your average tips
          earned per day and your paychecks for the past 30 days) and substracting your daily expense cost
          (the total cost of your expenses divided by 30 days). Throughout the day, the budget will update
          to reflect your expenditures for the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're over or under budget with your spending, then your budget for the next <strong>7 days</strong>
          will be adjusted to reflect this. So, if you're <em>over</em> budget, then your budget for the next
          7 days will be <em>reduced</em> slightly to make up for the loss, and if you're <em>under</em>, then
          your budget for the next 7 days will be <em>increased</em> slightly since you then have more to spend.

        What's the difference between an <strong>expense</strong> and an <strong>expenditure</strong>?

          <dt>An expense</dt>
          <dd>is a <strong>reoccuring</strong> bill or payment (e.g. rent, phone bill, car insurance)</dd>
          <dt>An expenditure</dt>
          <dd>is a <strong>one-off</strong> payment that isn't intended to happen regularly (e.g. lunch, dinner, coffee)</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          You may find that some things are more easily managed as expenses rather than expenditures.
          For example, if you buy the same bag of dog food each week, you could enter that as an <strong>expense</strong>,
          since you know you'll be buying it regularly.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, even though you may go out to lunch everyday, you should probably enter that
          as an <strong>expenditure</strong> since the cost will likely be different each time.

          We think this is a great idea. Presently, Tipout doesn't take into account money you have
          in savings or let you specify an amount of money you'd like to save each day or week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rest assured, however, that this is a feature we're actively developing and <strong>very soon</strong>
          you'll be able to keep track of savings as well.

          Yes, you absolutely can! If you'd like to enter your income only as paychecks and ignore the tips section,
          then Tipout will calculate your budget based on just the paychecks.

          For now, Tipout is just a web app (i.e. it runs in the browser). There are a couple of reasons for this.
          <ol>
            <li>
              First, with a web app we're able to deploy changes and updates immediately. Deploying an app through
              the Google Play Store or Apple's App Store takes time and you would have to update your version of the app
              every time an update is made. We want to be able to react quickly to your feedback, so it's
              important that we can do that without the added inconvenience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Second, Tipout simply runs very fast in the browser. Native apps tend to be fast once they get going
              but are slow to start. You'll find that Tipout launches quickly since it doesn't have the overhead
              of a native app.
            </li>
          </ol>
