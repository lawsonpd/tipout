for expenditures feature:

* what if an expenditure is > today's budget? do we return a negative budget? do we show a warning and ask if user wants to add a "special" expenditure that counts against their total monthly budget rather than daily budget?



paycheck feature:

to account for total income, user can add income from paychecks

add Paycheck model
budget should account for paycheck income



income feature:

user should be able to see total income, YTD and MTD, summing tips and paycheck




could one view for, e.g., expenditures handle all the parameters? perhaps they can be passed into the template and using template logic the right details can be shown. probably not, since the objects passed from the queries need to contain just the right info. test this in another app. could try using if/elif clauses to check for the presence of parameters (e.g. if args[2]:... elif args[1]...).
