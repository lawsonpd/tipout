for expenditures feature:

* what if an expenditure is > today's budget? do we return a negative budget? do we show a warning and ask if user wants to add a "special" expenditure that counts against their total monthly budget rather than daily budget?




income feature:

user should be able to see total income, YTD and MTD, summing tips and paycheck




could one view for, e.g., expenditures handle all the parameters? perhaps they can be passed into the template and using template logic the right details can be shown. probably not, since the objects passed from the queries need to contain just the right info. test this in another app. could try using if/elif clauses to check for the presence of parameters (e.g. if args[2]:... elif args[1]...).


** expenditures can be viewed by day or by month or... so the way they're queried for each changes. for now, assume you can only view expenditures from the current day. 


TODO:
-error messages
-session mgmt (after logout, still able to view back history)
[-cache]
-add urlconf for (each of) expenditures, expenses, tips (to include in main urlconf)
-get forms looking right
-add check in data submission to prevent duplicates
-HOME: explain that paychecks' amounts are NET
-*should expenses, expenditures, tips, and paychecks be 'owned' by Users or Employees?
-some views get objects by request.user and some by request.user.id. this should be consistent across views
-need some 'history' view of expenditures - order by month
-remove all users except test
